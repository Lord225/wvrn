# 🐾 Rawrsembler 🐾
Rawrsembler is a purr-ssembler for highly nefarius CPUs, providing a custom assembly language for advanced and obscure architectures. It's paws-itively perfect for those who want to scratch beneath the surface of low-level coding!

# Usage
```ps
python rawr.py -i ./program.wvrn -s bin # creates ./out/compiled.bin
python rawr.py -i ./program.wvrn -c -s pad # creates ./out/compiled.txt
```


## 🐱 Install
To set up Rawrsembler in your shell, simply claw into the repository and run the setup script:
```ps
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1
```
or
```ps
./setup.ps1
```
This script will:
🐾 Create a virtual environment (venv)
🐾 Add the alias rawr to python rawr.py (because every good kit needs a shortcut!)
🐾 Install a lint extension for VS Code to keep your code looking purr-fect

## 🐾 Uninstall
```
./revert.ps1
```
Now go forth and assemble with the grace of a prowling cat! 🐱✨
